```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  dpi = 300,
  fig.align = 'center'
  # message = FALSE,
  # warning = FALSE,
  # error = TRUE
)

# The following code allows the rmd document chunks to be evaluated
# and executed by setting the working directory to the folder where
# the document is located. This can be useful when you have `Chunk
# Output in Console` set or you are working with a different
# configuration/IDE than usual (rstudio for example). If you wish to
# handle this setting differently, you can comment out the line below
# or simply delete it.
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
